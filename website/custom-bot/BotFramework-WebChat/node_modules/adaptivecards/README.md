# Adaptive Cards

Adaptive Cards are a new way for developers to exchange card content in a common and consistent way.

## Expressive cards, open framework, multiple platforms

Break outside the box of templated cards. Adaptive Cards let you describe your content as you see fit and deliver it beautifully wherever your customers are.

The simple open card format enables an ecosystem of shared tooling, seamless integration between producers and consumers, and native cross-platorm performance on any device.

## Get Started

### Check out the [full documenation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/display/libraries/htmlclient) for more

## Install

### Node

```console
npm install adaptivecards --save
```

### CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/adaptivecards/dist/adaptivecards.js"></script>
```

## Usage

> **NOTE: BREAKING CHANGE**
>
> The standalone `renderCard()` helper function was removed as it was redundant with the class methods. Please use `adaptiveCard.render()` as described below.

### Import the module

```js
// Import the module:
import * as AdaptiveCards from "adaptivecards";

// Or require it:
var AdaptiveCards = require("adaptivecards");

// If you referenced the library from CDN, the global AdaptiveCards variable is already
// defined and can be used directly:
var adaptiveCard = new AdaptiveCards.AdaptiveCard();
```

### Render a card

```js
// Author a card
// In practice you'll probably get this from a service
// see http://adaptivecards.io/samples/ for inspiration
var card = {
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.0",
    "body": [
        {
            "type": "Image",
            "url": "http://adaptivecards.io/content/adaptive-card-50.png"
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Hello **Adaptive Cards!**"
        }
    ],
    "actions": [
        {
            "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
            "title": "Learn more",
            "url": "http://adaptivecards.io"
        },
        {
            "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
            "title": "GitHub",
            "url": "http://github.com/Microsoft/AdaptiveCards"
        }
    ]
};

// Create an AdaptiveCard instance
var adaptiveCard = new AdaptiveCards.AdaptiveCard();

// Set its hostConfig property unless you want to use the default Host Config
// Host Config defines the style and behavior of a card
adaptiveCard.hostConfig = new AdaptiveCards.HostConfig({
    fontFamily: "Segoe UI, Helvetica Nue, sans-serif"
    // More host config options
});

// Set the adaptive card's event handlers. onExecuteAction is invoked
// whenever an action is clicked in the card
adaptiveCard.onExecuteAction = function(action) { alert("Ow!"); }

// For markdown support you need a third-party library
// E.g., to use markdown-it, include in your HTML page:
//     <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/markdown-it/dist/markdown-it.js"></script>
// And add this code to replace the default markdown handler:
//     AdaptiveCards.processMarkdown = function(text) { return markdownit().render(text); }

// Parse the card payload
adaptiveCard.parse(card);

// Render the card to an HTML element:
var renderedCard = adaptiveCard.render();

// And finally insert it somewhere in your page:
document.body.appendChild(renderedCard);
```

## Webpack

If you don't want adaptivecards in your bundle, make sure the script is loaded and add the following the your `webpack.config.json`

```js
module.exports = {
  ...
  externals: [
    { adaptivecards: { var: "AdaptiveCards" } }
  ]
};
```
